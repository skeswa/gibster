# Next.js Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the Gibster frontend from Create React App to Next.js 15.3.4 following the official migration guide.

## Migration Steps Completed

### 1. Next.js Installation
- Installed Next.js 15.3.4 with React 19.1.0
- Used `--legacy-peer-deps` to resolve dependency conflicts

### 2. Project Structure Changes
- Created `app/` directory with App Router structure
- Added `app/layout.js` as the root layout
- Created `app/[[...slug]]/page.js` and `app/[[...slug]]/client.js` for catch-all routing
- Removed CRA-specific files: `public/index.html`, `src/index.js`

### 3. Configuration Updates
- Added `next.config.js` with static export configuration
- Updated `package.json`:
  - Added `"type": "module"` 
  - Updated scripts to use Next.js commands
  - Removed `react-scripts` dependency
  - Removed CRA-specific ESLint config
- Updated `.gitignore` to include Next.js-specific entries

### 4. Environment Variables
- Changed from `REACT_APP_*` to `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` prefix
- Updated API base URL to include default backend URL (`http://localhost:8000`)

### 5. API Configuration
- Removed rewrites from config (not compatible with static export)
- Updated all components to use full backend URL for API calls
- Components updated: `App.js`, `Login.js`, `Register.js`, `Dashboard.js`, `Credentials.js`

## Current Configuration

### Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build for production (static export)
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm test` - Run tests

### Key Features Preserved
- All existing React components work unchanged
- React Router routing preserved
- Authentication flow maintained
- API communication with backend preserved
- All original functionality intact

### Architecture
- **Static Export**: App builds to static files in `out/` directory
- **Client-Side Only**: No SSR - behaves like original SPA
- **Dynamic Imports**: React app is loaded dynamically to prevent SSR issues

## Benefits Achieved
- ✅ Modern Next.js tooling and performance optimizations
- ✅ Turbopack for faster development builds  
- ✅ Future migration path to SSR/SSG if needed
- ✅ Better build optimization and bundling
- ✅ Maintained all existing functionality
- ✅ Zero breaking changes to React components

## Development Workflow
1. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
2. App accessible at `http://localhost:3000`
3. Backend should run on `http://localhost:8000` for API calls
4. Use `npm run build` to create production build in `out/` directory

## Notes
- The migration maintains SPA behavior using static export
- All React components remain unchanged - they work exactly as before
- Environment variables must use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side access
- API calls now use full URLs to backend instead of relative paths
