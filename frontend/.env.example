# Frontend Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.local and update with your actual values

# === API Configuration ===
# Backend API URL - must be accessible from the browser
# For local development, this should match your backend server URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Production example:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.gibster.example.com

# Note: Environment variables in Next.js must be prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_
# to be accessible in the browser. Server-only variables don't need this prefix.

# === Calendar URL Configuration ===
# The frontend automatically proxies /calendar/* requests to the backend.
# To serve calendar URLs through the frontend domain, configure the backend's
# FRONTEND_BASE_URL environment variable to match your frontend URL.
# Example: FRONTEND_BASE_URL=https://app.gibster.com (in backend/.env)
