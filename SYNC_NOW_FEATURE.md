# Sync Now Feature Implementation

## Overview
The "Sync Now" feature allows users to manually trigger an immediate synchronization of their Gibney booking data instead of waiting for the scheduled 2-hour automatic sync. This feature provides real-time progress tracking and automatically reschedules future sync jobs.

## Key Requirements Met
✅ **Discoverable and Obvious**: Prominent "Sync Now" button in the dashboard  
✅ **Progress Observable**: Real-time status updates and progress messages  
✅ **Reschedule Future Jobs**: Automatic rescheduling of next sync job after manual trigger  

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### 1. New Database Model (`backend/models.py`)
- Added `SyncJob` model to track sync progress and history
- Added `last_sync_at` field to `User` model
- Relationships established between users and their sync jobs

#### 2. Enhanced API Endpoints (`backend/main.py`)
- **POST /api/v1/user/sync** - Enhanced to create sync jobs with progress tracking
- **GET /api/v1/user/sync/status** - New endpoint to get current sync status
- **GET /api/v1/user/sync/history** - New endpoint to get sync history

#### 3. Worker Enhancements (`backend/worker.py`)
- `sync_scrape_user_with_job_tracking()` - New function with detailed progress tracking
- `reschedule_next_sync()` - Reschedules automatic syncs after manual triggers
- Enhanced Celery task support for background processing

#### 4. New Schemas (`backend/schemas.py`)
- `SyncJobResponse` - For sync job data
- `SyncStartResponse` - For sync initiation response
- `SyncStatusResponse` - For current sync status

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Dashboard Enhancement (`frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`)
- Prominent "Sync Now" button with loading states
- Real-time progress tracking with polling
- Sync status display with visual indicators
- Automatic page refresh on successful completion

#### 2. CSS Styles (`frontend/src/index.css`)
- New sync status indicator styles
- Button states and animations
- Progress visualization classes
- Color-coded status badges

## User Experience Flow

1. **Initial State**: Dashboard shows last sync time and current status
2. **User Trigger**: User clicks "Sync Now" button
3. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates show:
   - "Initializing sync..."
   - "Connecting to Gibney..."
   - "Logging into Gibney..."
   - "Processing X bookings..."
4. **Completion**: Success message with booking count, automatic page refresh
5. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages if sync fails

## Technical Features

### Progress Tracking
- Real-time status updates during sync process
- Detailed progress messages at each stage
- Booking count tracking
- Error message capture and display

### Job Management
- Unique job ID for each sync operation
- Status tracking: pending → running → completed/failed
- Manual vs automatic sync differentiation
- Sync history retention

### Scheduling Intelligence
- Manual sync triggers reschedule next automatic sync
- Prevents overlapping sync operations
- 2-hour interval maintained after manual triggers

### Error Handling
- Graceful failure handling with error messages
- Partial sync completion tracking
- User-friendly error display

## API Endpoints

### Start Manual Sync
```
POST /api/v1/user/sync
Response: {
  "job_id": "uuid",
  "message": "Sync started successfully",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

### Get Sync Status
```
GET /api/v1/user/sync/status
Response: {
  "job": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "status": "completed",
    "progress": "Successfully synced 5 bookings",
    "bookings_synced": 5,
    "started_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00",
    "completed_at": "2024-01-01T12:02:00",
    "triggered_manually": true
  },
  "last_sync_at": "2024-01-01T12:02:00"
}
```

### Get Sync History
```
GET /api/v1/user/sync/history?limit=10
Response: {
  "jobs": [/* array of sync job objects */]
}
```

## Security & Performance

- Authentication required for all sync endpoints
- Rate limiting inherent through job-based system
- Background processing with Celery when available
- Graceful fallback to synchronous processing
- Automatic timeout handling (5-minute maximum)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Push notifications for sync completion
- Webhook support for external integrations
- Sync scheduling customization
- Bulk sync operations for multiple users
- Advanced filtering and sync options

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Database migration for new tables
- API endpoint validation
- Error handling verification
- Frontend state management testing

## Deployment Notes

1. Database migration required for `sync_jobs` table
2. Redis recommended for production Celery support
3. Environment variable `USE_CELERY` controls async behavior
4. Frontend builds with new dependencies automatically
